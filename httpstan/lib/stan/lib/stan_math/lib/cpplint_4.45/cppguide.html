<h2 class="ignoreLink" id="Background">Background</h2>

<p>C++ is the main development language  used by
many of Google's open-source projects. As every C++
programmer knows, the language has many powerful features, but
this power brings with it complexity, which in turn can make
code more bug-prone and harder to read and maintain.</p>

<p>The goal of this guide is to manage this complexity by
describing in detail the dos and don'ts of writing C++ code.
These rules exist to
keep  the code base manageable while still allowing
coders to use C++ language features productively.</p>

<p><em>Style</em>, also known as readability, is what we call
the conventions that govern our C++ code. The term Style is a
bit of a misnomer, since these conventions cover far more than
just source file formatting.</p>

<p>One way in which we keep the code base manageable is by
enforcing <em>consistency</em>.  It is very
important that any 
programmer be able to look at
another's code and quickly understand it. Maintaining a uniform
style and following conventions means that we can more easily
use "pattern-matching" to infer what various symbols are and
what invariants are true about them. Creating common, required
idioms and patterns makes code much easier to understand. In
some cases there might be good arguments for changing certain
style rules, but we nonetheless keep things as they are in
order to preserve consistency.</p>

<p>Another issue this guide addresses is that of C++ feature
bloat. C++ is a huge language with many advanced features. In
some cases we constrain, or even ban, use of certain features.
We do this to keep code simple and to avoid the various common
errors and problems that these features can cause. This guide
lists these features and explains why their use is
restricted.</p>

<p> Open-source projects
developed by Google conform to the requirements in this
guide.</p>



<p>Note that this guide is not a C++ tutorial: we assume that
the reader is familiar with the language. </p>

 

<h2 id="Header_Files">Header Files</h2>

<p>In general, every <code>.cc</code> file should have an
associated <code>.h</code> file. There are some common
exceptions, such as  unittests and
small <code>.cc</code> files containing just a
<code>main()</code> function.</p>

<p>Correct use of header files can make a huge difference to
the readability, size and performance of your code.</p>

<p>The following rules will guide you through the various
pitfalls of using header files.</p>

<a id="The_-inl.h_Files"></a>
<h3 id="Self_contained_Headers">Self-contained Headers</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Header files should be self-contained and end in <code>.h</code>. Files that
are meant for textual inclusion, but are not headers, should end in
<code>.inc</code>. Separate <code>-inl.h</code> headers are disallowed.</p>
</div> 

<div class="stylebody">
<p>All header files should be self-contained. In other
words, users and refactoring tools should not have to adhere to special
conditions in order to include the header. Specifically, a
header should have <a href="#The__define_Guard">header guards</a>,
should include all other headers it needs, and should not require any
particular symbols to be defined.</p>

<p>There are rare cases where a file is not meant to be self-contained, but
instead is meant to be textually included at a specific point in the code.
Examples are files that need to be included multiple times or
platform-specific extensions that essentially are part of other headers. Such
files should use the file extension <code>.inc</code>.</p>

<p>If a template or inline function is declared in a <code>.h</code> file,
define it in that same file. The definitions of these constructs must
be included into every <code>.cc</code> file that uses them, or the
program may fail to link in some build configurations. Do not move these
definitions to separate <code>-inl.h</code> files.</p>

<p>As an exception, a function template that is explicitly
instantiated for all relevant sets of template arguments, or
that is a private member of a class, may
be defined in the only <code>.cc</code> file that
instantiates the template.</p>

</div> 

<h3 id="The__define_Guard">The #define Guard</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>All header files should have <code>#define</code> guards to
prevent multiple inclusion. The format of the symbol name
should be
<code><i>&lt;PROJECT&gt;</i>_<i>&lt;PATH&gt;</i>_<i>&lt;FILE&gt;</i>_H_</code>.</p>
</div> 

<div class="stylebody">



<p>To guarantee uniqueness, they should
be based on the full path in a project's source tree. For
example, the file <code>foo/src/bar/baz.h</code> in
project <code>foo</code> should have the following
guard:</p>

<pre>#ifndef FOO_BAR_BAZ_H_
#define FOO_BAR_BAZ_H_

...

#endif  // FOO_BAR_BAZ_H_
</pre>




</div> 

<h3 id="Forward_Declarations">Forward Declarations</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>You may forward declare ordinary classes in order to avoid
unnecessary <code>#include</code>s.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<div class="definition">
<p>A "forward declaration" is a declaration of a class,
function, or template without an associated definition.
<code>#include</code> lines can often be replaced with
forward declarations of whatever symbols are actually
used by the client code.</p>
</div>

<div class="pros">
<ul>
  <li>Unnecessary <code>#include</code>s force the
  compiler to open more files and process more
  input.</li>

  <li>They can also force your code to be recompiled more
  often, due to changes in the header.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<ul>
  <li>It can be difficult to determine the correct form
  of a forward declaration in the presence of features
  like templates, typedefs, default parameters, and using
  declarations.</li>

  <li>It can be difficult to determine whether a forward
  declaration or a full <code>#include</code> is needed
  for a given piece of code, particularly when implicit
  conversion operations are involved. In extreme cases,
  replacing an <code>#include</code> with a forward
  declaration can silently change the meaning of
  code.</li>

  <li>Forward declaring multiple symbols from a header
  can be more verbose than simply
  <code>#include</code>ing the header.</li>

  <li>Forward declarations of functions and templates can
  prevent the header owners from making
  otherwise-compatible changes to their APIs; for
  example, widening a parameter type, or adding a
  template parameter with a default value.</li>
  <li>Forward declaring symbols from namespace
  <code>std::</code> usually yields undefined
  behavior.</li>

  <li>Structuring code to enable forward declarations
  (e.g. using pointer members instead of object members)
  can make the code slower and more complex.</li>

  <li>The practical efficiency benefits of forward
  declarations are unproven.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="decision">
<ul>
  <li>When using a function declared in a header file,
  always <code>#include</code> that header.</li>

  <li>When using a class template, prefer to
  <code>#include</code> its header file.</li>

  <li>When using an ordinary class, relying on a forward
  declaration is OK, but be wary of situations where a
  forward declaration may be insufficient or incorrect;
  when in doubt, just <code>#include</code> the
  appropriate header.</li>

  <li>Do not replace data members with pointers just to
  avoid an <code>#include</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please see <a href="#Names_and_Order_of_Includes">Names and Order
of Includes</a> for rules about when to #include a header.</p>
</div>

</div> 

<h3 id="Inline_Functions">Inline Functions</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Define functions inline only when they are small, say, 10
lines or less.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<div class="definition">
<p>You can declare functions in a way that allows the compiler to expand
them inline rather than calling them through the usual
function call mechanism.</p>
</div>

<div class="pros">
<p>Inlining a function can generate more efficient object
code, as long as the inlined function is small. Feel free
to inline accessors and mutators, and other short,
performance-critical functions.</p>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<p>Overuse of inlining can actually make programs slower.
Depending on a function's size, inlining it can cause the
code size to increase or decrease. Inlining a very small
accessor function will usually decrease code size while
inlining a very large function can dramatically increase
code size. On modern processors smaller code usually runs
faster due to better use of the instruction cache.</p>
</div>

<div class="decision">
<p>A decent rule of thumb is to not inline a function if
it is more than 10 lines long. Beware of destructors,
which are often longer than they appear because of
implicit member- and base-destructor calls!</p>

<p>Another useful rule of thumb: it's typically not cost
effective to inline functions with loops or switch
statements (unless, in the common case, the loop or
switch statement is never executed).</p>

<p>It is important to know that functions are not always
inlined even if they are declared as such; for example,
virtual and recursive functions are not normally inlined.
Usually recursive functions should not be inline. The
main reason for making a virtual function inline is to
place its definition in the class, either for convenience
or to document its behavior, e.g., for accessors and
mutators.</p>
</div> 

</div> 

<h3 id="Function_Parameter_Ordering">Function Parameter Ordering</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>When defining a function, parameter order is: inputs, then
outputs.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">
<p>Parameters to C/C++ functions are either input to the
function, output from the function, or both. Input
parameters are usually values or <code>const</code>
references, while output and input/output parameters will
be non-<code>const</code> pointers. When ordering
function parameters, put all input-only parameters before
any output parameters. In particular, do not add new
parameters to the end of the function just because they
are new; place new input-only parameters before the
output parameters.</p>

<p>This is not a hard-and-fast rule. Parameters that are
both input and output (often classes/structs) muddy the
waters, and, as always, consistency with related
functions may require you to bend the rule.</p>

</div> 

<h3 id="Names_and_Order_of_Includes">Names and Order of Includes</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Use standard order for readability and to avoid hidden
dependencies: Related header, C library, C++ library,  other libraries'
<code>.h</code>, your project's <code>.h</code>.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">
<p>
All of a project's header files should be
listed as descendants of the project's source
directory without use of UNIX directory shortcuts
<code>.</code> (the current directory) or <code>..</code>
(the parent directory). For example,

<code>google-awesome-project/src/base/logging.h</code>
should be included as:</p>

<pre>#include "base/logging.h"
</pre>

<p>In <code><var>dir/foo</var>.cc</code> or
<code><var>dir/foo_test</var>.cc</code>, whose main
purpose is to implement or test the stuff in
<code><var>dir2/foo2</var>.h</code>, order your includes
as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code><var>dir2/foo2</var>.h</code>.</li>

  <li>C system files.</li>

  <li>C++ system files.</li>

  <li>Other libraries' <code>.h</code>
  files.</li>

  <li>
  Your project's <code>.h</code>
  files.</li>
</ol>

<p>With the preferred ordering, if
<code><var>dir2/foo2</var>.h</code> omits any necessary
includes, the build of <code><var>dir/foo</var>.cc</code>
or <code><var>dir/foo</var>_test.cc</code> will break.
Thus, this rule ensures that build breaks show up first
for the people working on these files, not for innocent
people in other packages.</p>

<p><code><var>dir/foo</var>.cc</code> and
<code><var>dir2/foo2</var>.h</code> are usually in the same
directory (e.g. <code>base/basictypes_test.cc</code> and
<code>base/basictypes.h</code>), but may sometimes be in different
directories too.</p>



<p>Within each section the includes should be ordered
alphabetically. Note that older code might not conform to
this rule and should be fixed when convenient.</p>

<p>You should include all the headers that define the symbols you rely
upon (except in cases of <a href="#Forward_Declarations">forward
declaration</a>). If you rely on symbols from <code>bar.h</code>,
don't count on the fact that you included <code>foo.h</code> which
(currently) includes <code>bar.h</code>: include <code>bar.h</code>
yourself, unless <code>foo.h</code> explicitly demonstrates its intent
to provide you the symbols of <code>bar.h</code>.  However, any
includes present in the related header do not need to be included
again in the related <code>cc</code> (i.e., <code>foo.cc</code> can
rely on <code>foo.h</code>'s includes).</p>

<p>For example, the includes in

<code>google-awesome-project/src/foo/internal/fooserver.cc</code>
might look like this:</p>


<pre>#include "foo/server/fooserver.h"

#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;hash_map&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

#include "base/basictypes.h"
#include "base/commandlineflags.h"
#include "foo/server/bar.h"
</pre>

<p class="exception">Sometimes, system-specific code needs
conditional includes. Such code can put conditional
includes after other includes. Of course, keep your
system-specific code small and localized. Example:</p>

<pre>#include "foo/public/fooserver.h"

#include "base/port.h"  // For LANG_CXX11.

#ifdef LANG_CXX11
#include &lt;initializer_list&gt;
#endif  // LANG_CXX11
</pre>

</div> 

<h2 id="Scoping">Scoping</h2>

<h3 id="Namespaces">Namespaces</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Unnamed namespaces in <code>.cc</code> files are
encouraged. With named namespaces, choose the name based on
the 
project, and possibly its
path. Do not use a <i>using-directive</i>.
Do not use inline namespaces.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<div class="definition">
<p>Namespaces subdivide the global scope
into distinct, named scopes, and so are useful for preventing
name collisions in the global scope.</p>
</div>

<div class="pros">

<p>Namespaces provide a (hierarchical) axis of naming, in
addition to the (also hierarchical) name axis provided by
classes.</p>

<p>For example, if two different projects have a class
<code>Foo</code> in the global scope, these symbols may
collide at compile time or at runtime. If each project
places their code in a namespace,
<code>project1::Foo</code> and <code>project2::Foo</code>
are now distinct symbols that do not collide.</p>

<p>Inline namespaces automatically place their names in
the enclosing scope. Consider the following snippet, for
example:</p>

<pre>namespace X {
inline namespace Y {
  void foo();
}
}
</pre>

<p>The expressions <code>X::Y::foo()</code> and
<code>X::foo()</code> are interchangeable. Inline
namespaces are primarily intended for ABI compatibility
across versions.</p>
</div>

<div class="cons">

<p>Namespaces can be confusing, because they provide an
additional (hierarchical) axis of naming, in addition to
the (also hierarchical) name axis provided by
classes.</p>

<p>Inline namespaces, in particular, can be confusing
because names aren't actually restricted to the namespace
where they are declared. They are only useful as part of
some larger versioning policy.</p>

<p>Use of unnamed namespaces in header files can easily
cause violations of the C++ One Definition Rule
(ODR).</p>
</div>

<div class="decision">

<p>Use namespaces according to the policy described
below. Terminate namespaces with comments as shown in the
given examples.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="stylepoint_subsection">Unnamed Namespaces</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Unnamed namespaces are allowed and even encouraged
  in <code>.cc</code> files, to avoid link time naming
  conflicts:</p>

<pre>namespace {                           // This is in a .cc file.

// The content of a namespace is not indented.
//
// This function is guaranteed not to generate a colliding symbol
// with other symbols at link time, and is only visible to
// callers in this .cc file.
bool UpdateInternals(Frobber* f, int newval) {
  ...
}

}  // namespace
</pre>

  <p>However, file-scope declarations that are
  associated with a particular class may be declared in
  that class as types, static data members or static
  member functions rather than as members of an unnamed
  namespace.</p>
  </li>

  <li>Do not use unnamed namespaces in <code>.h</code>
  files.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="stylepoint_subsection">Named Namespaces</h4>

<p>Named namespaces should be used as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Namespaces wrap the entire source file after
  includes,  
  <a href="http://google-gflags.googlecode.com/">
  gflags</a> definitions/declarations, and
  forward declarations of classes from other namespaces:</p>

<pre>// In the .h file
namespace mynamespace {

// All declarations are within the namespace scope.
// Notice the lack of indentation.
class MyClass {
 public:
  ...
  void Foo();
};

}  // namespace mynamespace
</pre>

<pre>// In the .cc file
namespace mynamespace {

// Definition of functions is within scope of the namespace.
void MyClass::Foo() {
  ...
}

}  // namespace mynamespace
</pre>

  <p>The typical <code>.cc</code> file might have more
  complex detail, including the need to reference
  classes in other namespaces.</p>


<pre>#include "a.h"

DEFINE_bool(someflag, false, "dummy flag");

class C;  // Forward declaration of class C in the global namespace.
namespace a { class A; }  // Forward declaration of a::A.

namespace b {

...code for b...         // Code goes against the left margin.

}  // namespace b
</pre>
  </li>

  

  <li>Do not declare anything in namespace
  <code>std</code>, not even forward declarations of
  standard library classes. Declaring entities in
  namespace <code>std</code> is undefined behavior, i.e.,
  not portable. To declare entities from the standard
  library, include the appropriate header file.</li>

  <li><p>You may not use a <i>using-directive</i>
  to make all names from a namespace available.</p>

<pre class="badcode">// Forbidden -- This pollutes the namespace.
using namespace foo;
</pre>
  </li>

  <li><p>You may use a <i>using-declaration</i>
  anywhere in a <code>.cc</code> file, and in functions,
  methods or classes in <code>.h</code> files.</p>

<pre>// OK in .cc files.
// Must be in a function, method or class in .h files.
using ::foo::bar;
</pre>
  </li>

  <li><p>Namespace aliases are allowed anywhere in a <code>
  .cc</code> file, anywhere inside the named namespace
  that wraps an entire <code>.h</code> file, and in
  functions and methods.</p>

<pre>// Shorten access to some commonly used names in .cc files.
namespace fbz = ::foo::bar::baz;

// Shorten access to some commonly used names (in a .h file).
namespace librarian {
// The following alias is available to all files including
// this header (in namespace librarian):
// alias names should therefore be chosen consistently
// within a project.
namespace pd_s = ::pipeline_diagnostics::sidetable;

inline void my_inline_function() {
  // namespace alias local to a function (or method).
  namespace fbz = ::foo::bar::baz;
  ...
}
}  // namespace librarian
</pre>

  <p>Note that an alias in a .h file is visible to
  everyone #including that file, so public headers
  (those available outside a project) and headers
  transitively #included by them, should avoid defining
  aliases, as part of the general goal of keeping
  public APIs as small as possible.</p>
  </li>

  <li>Do not use inline namespaces.</li>
</ul>

 

 

 
</div> 

<h3 id="Nested_Classes">Nested Classes</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Although you may use public nested classes when they are
part of an interface, consider a <a href="#Namespaces">namespace</a>
to keep declarations out of the global scope.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<div class="definition">
<p>A class can define another class within it; this is also
called a <i>member class</i>.</p>


<pre>class Foo {

 private:
  // Bar is a member class, nested within Foo.
  class Bar {
    ...
  };

};
</pre>
</div>

<div class="pros">
<p>This is useful when the nested (or member) class is only
used by the enclosing class; making it a member puts it
in the enclosing class scope rather than polluting the
outer scope with the class name. Nested classes can be
forward declared within the enclosing class and then
defined in the <code>.cc</code> file to avoid including
the nested class definition in the enclosing class
declaration, since the nested class definition is usually
only relevant to the implementation.</p>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<p>Nested classes can be forward-declared only within the
definition of the enclosing class. Thus, any header file
manipulating a <code>Foo::Bar*</code> pointer will have
to include the full class declaration for
<code>Foo</code>.</p>
</div>

<div class="decision">
<p>Do not make nested classes public unless they are
actually part of the interface, e.g., a class that holds a
set of options for some method. </p>
</div>

</div> 

<h3 id="Nonmember,_Static_Member,_and_Global_Functions">Nonmember, Static Member, and Global Functions</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Prefer nonmember functions within a namespace or static
member functions to global functions; use completely global
functions rarely.</p>
</div>

 <div class="stylebody">

 <div class="pros">
 <p>Nonmember and static member functions can be useful in
 some situations. Putting nonmember functions in a
 namespace avoids polluting the global namespace.</p>
 </div>

<div class="cons">
<p>Nonmember and static member functions may make more sense
as members of a new class, especially if they access
external resources or have significant dependencies.</p>
</div>

<div class="decision">
<p>Sometimes it is useful, or even necessary, to define a
function not bound to a class instance. Such a function
can be either a static member or a nonmember function.
Nonmember functions should not depend on external
variables, and should nearly always exist in a namespace.
Rather than creating classes only to group static member
functions which do not share static data, use
<a href="#Namespaces">namespaces</a> instead.</p>

<p>Functions defined in the same compilation unit as
production classes may introduce unnecessary coupling and
link-time dependencies when directly called from other
compilation units; static member functions are
particularly susceptible to this. Consider extracting a
new class, or placing the functions in a namespace
possibly in a separate library.</p>

<p>If you must define a nonmember function and it is only
needed in its <code>.cc</code> file, use an unnamed
<a href="#Namespaces">namespace</a> or
<code>static</code> linkage (eg <code>static int Foo()
{...}</code>) to limit its scope.</p>
</div>

</div> 

<h3 id="Local_Variables">Local Variables</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Place a function's variables in the narrowest scope
possible, and initialize variables in the declaration.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<p>C++ allows you to declare variables anywhere in a
function. We encourage you to declare them in as local a
scope as possible, and as close to the first use as
possible. This makes it easier for the reader to find the
declaration and see what type the variable is and what it
was initialized to. In particular, initialization should
be used instead of declaration and assignment, e.g.:</p>

<pre class="badcode">int i;
i = f();      // Bad -- initialization separate from declaration.
</pre>

<pre>int j = g();  // Good -- declaration has initialization.
</pre>

<pre class="badcode">vector&lt;int&gt; v;
v.push_back(1);  // Prefer initializing using brace initialization.
v.push_back(2);
</pre>

<pre>vector&lt;int&gt; v = {1, 2};  // Good -- v starts initialized.
</pre>

<p>Variables needed for <code>if</code>, <code>while</code>
and <code>for</code> statements should normally be declared
within those statements, so that such variables are confined
to those scopes.  E.g.:</p>

<pre>while (const char* p = strchr(str, '/')) str = p + 1;
</pre>

<p>There is one caveat: if the variable is an object, its
constructor is invoked every time it enters scope and is
created, and its destructor is invoked every time it goes
out of scope.</p>

<pre class="badcode">// Inefficient implementation:
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; ++i) {
  Foo f;  // My ctor and dtor get called 1000000 times each.
  f.DoSomething(i);
}
</pre>

<p>It may be more efficient to declare such a variable
used in a loop outside that loop:</p>

<pre>Foo f;  // My ctor and dtor get called once each.
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; ++i) {
  f.DoSomething(i);
}
</pre>

</div> 

<h3 id="Static_and_Global_Variables">Static and Global Variables</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Static or global variables of class type are forbidden:
they cause hard-to-find bugs due to indeterminate order of
construction and destruction. However, such variables are
allowed if they are <code>constexpr</code>: they have no
dynamic initialization or destruction.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<p>Objects with static storage duration, including global
variables, static variables, static class member
variables, and function static variables, must be Plain
Old Data (POD): only ints, chars, floats, or pointers, or
arrays/structs of POD.</p>

<p>The order in which class constructors and initializers
for static variables are called is only partially
specified in C++ and can even change from build to build,
which can cause bugs that are difficult to find.
Therefore in addition to banning globals of class type,
we do not allow static POD variables to be initialized
with the result of a function, unless that function (such
as getenv(), or getpid()) does not itself depend on any
other globals. (This prohibition does not apply to a static
variable within function scope, since its initialization
order is well-defined and does not occur until control
passes through its declaration.)</p>

<p>Likewise, global and static variables are destroyed
when the program terminates, regardless of whether the
termination is by returning from <code>main()</code> or
by calling <code>exit()</code>. The order in which
destructors are called is defined to be the reverse of
the order in which the constructors were called. Since
constructor order is indeterminate, so is destructor
order. For example, at program-end time a static variable
might have been destroyed, but code still running
&#8212; perhaps in another thread
&#8212; tries to access it and fails. Or the
destructor for a static <code>string</code> variable
might be run prior to the destructor for another variable
that contains a reference to that string.</p>

<p>One way to alleviate the destructor problem is to
terminate the program by calling
<code>quick_exit()</code> instead of <code>exit()</code>.
The difference is that <code>quick_exit()</code> does not
invoke destructors and does not invoke any handlers that
were registered by calling <code>atexit()</code>. If you
have a handler that needs to run when a program
terminates via <code>quick_exit()</code> (flushing logs,
for example), you can register it using
<code>at_quick_exit()</code>. (If you have a handler that
needs to run at both <code>exit()</code> and
<code>quick_exit()</code>, you need to register it in
both places.)</p>

<p>As a result we only allow static variables to contain
POD data. This rule completely disallows

<p>If you need a static or global
variable of a class type, consider initializing a pointer
(which will never be freed), from either your main()
function or from pthread_once(). Note that this must be a
raw pointer, not a "smart" pointer, since the smart
pointer's destructor will have the order-of-destructor
issue that we are trying to avoid.</p>

  errors, short of using exceptions (which are
  <a href="#Exceptions">forbidden</a>).</li>

  <li>If the work fails, we now have an object whose

  indeterminate state.</li>

  <li>If the work calls virtual functions, these calls
  will not get dispatched to the subclass
  implementations. Future modification to your class can
  quietly introduce this problem even if your class is
  not currently subclassed, causing much confusion.</li>

  <li>If someone creates a global variable of this type

  assumptions in the constructor code. For instance,

</ul>

<div class="decision">
<p>Constructors should never call virtual functions or
attempt to raise non-fatal failures. If your object requires
non-trivial initialization, consider using

</div>

</div> 

<h3 id="Initialization">Initialization</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>If your class defines member variables, you must provide an
in-class initializer for every member variable or write a
constructor (which can be a default constructor). If you do
not declare any constructors yourself then the compiler
will generate a default constructor for you, which may
leave some fields uninitialized or initialized to
inappropriate values.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<div class="definition">
<p>The default constructor is called when we
<code>new</code> a class object with no arguments. It is always
called when calling <code>new[]</code> (for arrays). In-class
member initialization means declaring a member variable using a
construction like <code>int count_ = 17;</code> or
<code>string name_{"abc"};</code>, as opposed to just
<code>int count_;</code> or <code>string name_;</code>.</p>
</div>

<div class="pros">
<p>A user-defined default constructor is used to
initialize an object if no initializer is provided. It
can ensure that an object is always in a valid and usable
state as soon as it's constructed; it can also ensure
that an object is initially created in an obviously
"impossible" state, to aid debugging.</p>

<p>In-class member initialization ensures that a member
variable will be initialized appropriately without having
to duplicate the initialization code in multiple
constructors. This can reduce bugs where you add a new
member variable, initialize it in one constructor, and
forget to put that initialization code in another
constructor.</p>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<p>Explicitly defining a default constructor is extra
work for you, the code writer.</p>

<p>In-class member initialization is potentially
confusing if a member variable is initialized as part of
its declaration and also initialized in a constructor,
since the value in the constructor will override the
value in the declaration.</p>
</div>

<div class="decision">
<p>Use in-class member initialization for simple
initializations, especially when a member variable must
be initialized the same way in more than one
constructor.</p>

<p>If your class defines member variables that aren't
initialized in-class, and if it has no other
constructors, you must define a default constructor (one
that takes no arguments). It should preferably initialize
the object in such a way that its internal state is
consistent and valid.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that if you have no other
constructors and do not define a default constructor, the
compiler will generate one for you. This compiler
generated constructor may not initialize your object
sensibly.</p>

<p>If your class inherits from an existing class but you
add no new member variables, you are not required to have
a default constructor. </p>

<h3 id="Explicit_Constructors">Explicit Constructors</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Use the C++ keyword <code>explicit</code> for constructors
callable with one argument.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<div class="definition">
<p> Normally, if a
constructor can be called with one argument, it can be used as a
conversion. For instance, if you define
<code>Foo::Foo(string name)</code> and then pass a string
to a function that expects a <code>Foo</code>, the
constructor will be called to convert the string into a
<code>Foo</code> and will pass the <code>Foo</code> to
your function for you. This can be convenient but is also
a source of trouble when things get converted and new
objects created without you meaning them to. Declaring a
constructor <code>explicit</code> prevents it from being
invoked implicitly as a conversion.</p>
<p>In addition to single-parameter constructors, this also
applies to constructors where every parameter after the
first has a default value, e.g.,
<code>Foo::Foo(string name, int id = 42)</code>.</p>

<p>We require all constructors that are callable with

<code>explicit</code>.  Classes that are intended to be transparent
wrappers around other classes are also exceptions.
Such exceptions should be clearly marked with
comments.</p>

<p>Finally, constructors that take only a
<code>std::initializer_list</code> may be non-explicit. This permits
construction of your type from a <a href="#Braced_Initializer_List">braced initializer list</a>, as in an assignment-style initialization,

<p>Support copying and/or moving if it makes sense for your type.
Otherwise, disable the implicitly generated special
functions that perform copies and moves.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<div class="definition">
<p>A copyable type allows its objects to be initialized or assigned
from any other object of the same type, without changing the value of the source.
For user-defined types, the copy behavior is defined by the copy
constructor and the copy-assignment operator.
<code>string</code> is an example of a copyable type.</p>

<p>A movable type is one that can be initialized and assigned
from temporaries (all copyable types are therefore movable).
<code>std::unique_ptr&lt;int&gt;</code> is an example of a movable but not
copyable type. For user-defined types, the move behavior is defined by the move
constructor and the move-assignment operator.</p>

<p>The copy/move constructors can be implicitly invoked by the compiler
in some situations, e.g. when passing objects by value.</p>
</div>

<div class="pros">
<p>Objects of copyable and movable types can be passed and returned
by value, which makes APIs simpler, safer, and more general.
Unlike when passing pointers or references, there's no risk of
confusion over ownership, lifetime, mutability, and similar
issues, and no need to specify them in the contract. It also
prevents non-local interactions between the client and the
implementation, which makes them easier to understand and
maintain. Such objects can be used with generic
APIs that require pass-by-value, such as most containers.</p>

<p>Copy/move constructors and assignment operators are usually
easier to define correctly than alternatives
like <code>Clone()</code>, <code>CopyFrom()</code> or <code>Swap()</code>,
because they can be generated by the compiler, either implicitly or
with <code>= default</code>.  They are concise, and ensure
that all data members are copied. Copy and move
constructors are also generally more efficient, because they don't
require heap allocation or separate initialization and assignment
steps, and they're eligible for optimizations such as

<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/copy_elision">
copy elision</a>.</p>

<p>Move operations allow the implicit and efficient transfer of
resources out of rvalue objects. This allows a plainer coding style
in some cases.</p>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<p>Many types do not need to be copyable, and providing copy
operations for them can be confusing, nonsensical, or outright
incorrect. Copy/assigment operations for base class types are
hazardous, because use of them can lead to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_slicing">object
slicing</a>. Defaulted or carelessly-implemented copy operations
can be incorrect, and the resulting bugs can be confusing and
difficult to diagnose.</p>

<p>Copy constructors are invoked implicitly, which makes the
invocation easy to miss. This may cause confusion, particularly
for programmers used to languages where pass-by-reference is
conventional or mandatory. It may also encourage excessive
copying, which can cause performance problems.</p>


</div>

<div class="decision">

<p>Make your type copyable/movable if it will be useful, and if it
makes sense in the context of the rest of the API.
As a rule of thumb, if the behavior (including computational
complexity) of a copy isn't immediately obvious to users of your type,
your type shouldn't be copyable.  If you choose to make it copyable,
define both copy operations (constructor and assignment).  If your
type is copyable and a move operation is more efficient than a copy,
define both move operations (constructor and assignment).
If your type is not copyable, but the correctness of a move is obvious
to users of the type and its fields support it, you may make the type
move-only by defining both of the move operations.
</p>

<p>Prefer to define copy and move operations with <code>= default</code>.
Defining non-default move operations currently requires a style
exception. Remember to review the correctness of any defaulted
operations as you would any other code.
</p>

<p>Due to the risk of slicing, avoid providing an assignment
operator or public copy/move constructor for a class that's
intended to be derived from (and avoid deriving from a class
with such members). If your base class needs to be
copyable, provide a public virtual <code>Clone()</code>
method, and a protected copy constructor that derived classes
can use to implement it.</p>

<p>If you do not want to support copy/move operations on
your type, explicitly disable them using <code>= delete</code> or
whatever
other mechanism your project uses.

<h3 id="Delegating_and_inheriting_constructors">Delegating and Inheriting Constructors</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p> Use delegating and inheriting
constructors when they reduce code duplication.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<div class="definition">

<p>Delegating and inheriting constructors are two
different features, both introduced in C++11, for
reducing code duplication in constructors. Delegating
constructors allow one of a class's constructors to
forward work to one of the class's other constructors,
using a special variant of the initialization list
syntax. For example:</p>

<pre>X::X(const string&amp; name) : name_(name) {
  ...
}

X::X() : X("") { }
</pre>

<p>Inheriting constructors allow a derived class to have
its base class's constructors available directly, just as
with any of the base class's other member functions,
instead of having to redeclare them. This is especially
useful if the base has multiple constructors. For
example:</p>

<pre>class Base {
 public:
  Base();
  Base(int n);
  Base(const string&amp; s);
  ...
};

class Derived : public Base {
 public:
  using Base::Base;  // Base's constructors are redeclared here.
};
</pre>

<p>This is especially useful when <code>Derived</code>'s
constructors don't have to do anything more than calling
<code>Base</code>'s constructors.</p>
</div>

<div class="pros">
<p>Delegating and inheriting constructors reduce
verbosity and boilerplate, which can improve
readability.</p>

<p>Delegating constructors are familiar to Java
programmers.</p>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<p>It's possible to approximate the behavior of
delegating constructors by using a helper function.</p>

<p>Inheriting constructors may be confusing if a derived
class introduces new member variables, since the base
class constructor doesn't know about them.</p>
</div>

<div class="decision">
<p>Use delegating and inheriting constructors when they reduce
boilerplate and improve readability.
Be cautious about inheriting constructors when your derived class has
new member variables. Inheriting constructors may still be appropriate
in that case if you can use in-class member initialization
for the derived class's member variables.</p>

<div class="stylebody">

<p>The <code>struct</code> and <code>class</code>
keywords behave almost identically in C++. We add our own
semantic meanings to each keyword, so you should use the

<p><code>structs</code> should be used for passive
objects that carry data, and may have associated
constants, but lack any functionality other than
access/setting the data members. The accessing/setting of
fields is done by directly accessing the fields rather
than through method invocations. Methods should not
provide behavior but should only be used to set up the
data members, e.g., constructor, destructor,

<p>If more functionality is required, a

<h3 id="Inheritance">Inheritance</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Composition is often more appropriate than inheritance.
When using inheritance, make it <code>public</code>.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<div class="definition">
<p> When a sub-class
inherits from a base class, it includes the definitions
of all the data and operations that the parent base class
defines. In practice, inheritance is used in two major
ways in C++: implementation inheritance, in which actual
code is inherited by the child, and
<a href="#Interfaces">interface inheritance</a>, in which
only method names are inherited.</p>
</div>

<div class="pros">
<p>Implementation inheritance reduces code size by re-using
the base class code as it specializes an existing type.
Because inheritance is a compile-time declaration, you
and the compiler can understand the operation and detect
errors. Interface inheritance can be used to
programmatically enforce that a class expose a particular
API. Again, the compiler can detect errors, in this case,
when a class does not define a necessary method of the
API.</p>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<p>For implementation inheritance, because the code
implementing a sub-class is spread between the base and
the sub-class, it can be more difficult to understand an
implementation. The sub-class cannot override functions
that are not virtual, so the sub-class cannot change
implementation. The base class may also define some data
members, so that specifies physical layout of the base
class.</p>
</div>

<div class="decision">

<p>All inheritance should be <code>public</code>. If you
want to do private inheritance, you should be including
an instance of the base class as a member instead.</p>

<p>Do not overuse implementation inheritance. Composition
is often more appropriate. Try to restrict use of
inheritance to the "is-a" case: <code>Bar</code>
subclasses <code>Foo</code> if it can reasonably be said
that <code>Bar</code> "is a kind of"
<code>Foo</code>.</p>

<p>Make your destructor <code>virtual</code> if
necessary. If your class has virtual methods, its
destructor  should be virtual.</p>

<p>Limit the use of <code>protected</code> to those
member functions that might need to be accessed from
subclasses. Note that <a href="#Access_Control">data
members should be private</a>.</p>

<p>Explicitly annotate overrides of virtual functions
or virtual destructors with an <code>override</code>
or (less frequently) <code>final</code> specifier.
Older (pre-C++11) code will use the
<code>virtual</code> keyword as an inferior
alternative annotation. For clarity, use exactly one of
<code>override</code>, <code>final</code>, or
<code>virtual</code> when declaring an override.
Rationale: A function or destructor marked
<code>override</code> or <code>final</code> that is
not an override of a base class virtual function will
not compile, and this helps catch common errors. The
specifiers serve as documentation; if no specifier is
present, the reader has to check all ancestors of the
class in question to determine if the function or
destructor is virtual or not.</p>

responsible for deleting it. Even when ownership is not
shared, it can be transferred from one piece of code to
another.</p>

<p>"Smart" pointers are classes that act like pointers,
e.g. by overloading the <code>*</code> and
<code>-&gt;</code> operators. Some smart pointer types
can be used to automate ownership bookkeeping, to ensure
these responsibilities are met.
<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr">
<code>std::unique_ptr</code></a> is a smart pointer type
introduced in C++11, which expresses exclusive ownership
of a dynamically allocated object; the object is deleted
when the <code>std::unique_ptr</code> goes out of scope.
It cannot be copied, but can be <em>moved</em> to
represent ownership transfer.
<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr">
<code>std::shared_ptr</code></a> is a smart pointer type
that expresses shared ownership of
a dynamically allocated object. <code>std::shared_ptr</code>s
can be copied; ownership of the object is shared among
all copies, and the object is deleted when the last
<code>std::shared_ptr</code> is destroyed. </p>
</div>

<div class="pros">
<ul>
  <li>It's virtually impossible to manage dynamically
  allocated memory without some sort of ownership
  logic.</li>

  <li>Transferring ownership of an object can be cheaper
  than copying it (if copying it is even possible).</li>

  <li>Transferring ownership can be simpler than
  'borrowing' a pointer or reference, because it reduces
  the need to coordinate the lifetime of the object
  between the two users.</li>

  <li>Smart pointers can improve readability by making
  ownership logic explicit, self-documenting, and
  unambiguous.</li>

  <li>Smart pointers can eliminate manual ownership
  bookkeeping, simplifying the code and ruling out large
  classes of errors.</li>

  <li>For const objects, shared ownership can be a simple
  and efficient alternative to deep copying.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<ul>
  <li>Ownership must be represented and transferred via
  pointers (whether smart or plain). Pointer semantics
  are more complicated than value semantics, especially
  in APIs: you have to worry not just about ownership,
  but also aliasing, lifetime, and mutability, among
  other issues.</li>

  <li>The performance costs of value semantics are often
  overestimated, so the performance benefits of ownership
  transfer might not justify the readability and
  complexity costs.</li>

  <li>APIs that transfer ownership force their clients
  into a single memory management model.</li>

  <li>Code using smart pointers is less explicit about
  where the resource releases take place.</li>

  <li><code>std::unique_ptr</code> expresses ownership
  transfer using C++11's move semantics, which are
  relatively new and may confuse some programmers.</li>

  <li>Shared ownership can be a tempting alternative to
  careful ownership design, obfuscating the design of a
  system.</li>

  <li>Shared ownership requires explicit bookkeeping at
  run-time, which can be costly.</li>

  <li>In some cases (e.g. cyclic references), objects
  with shared ownership may never be deleted.</li>

  <li>Smart pointers are not perfect substitutes for
  plain pointers.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="decision">
<p>If dynamic allocation is necessary, prefer to keep
ownership with the code that allocated it. If other code
needs access to the object, consider passing it a copy,
or passing a pointer or reference without transferring
ownership. Prefer to use <code>std::unique_ptr</code> to
make ownership transfer explicit. For example:</p>

<pre>std::unique_ptr&lt;Foo&gt; FooFactory();
void FooConsumer(std::unique_ptr&lt;Foo&gt; ptr);
</pre>



<p>Do not design your code to use shared ownership
without a very good reason. One such reason is to avoid
expensive copy operations, but you should only do this if
the performance benefits are significant, and the
underlying object is immutable (i.e.
<code>std::shared_ptr&lt;const Foo&gt;</code>).  If you
do use shared ownership, prefer to use
<code>std::shared_ptr</code>.</p>

<p>Do not use <code>scoped_ptr</code> in new code unless
you need to be compatible with older versions of C++.
Never use <code>std::auto_ptr</code>. Instead, use
<code>std::unique_ptr</code>.</p>

</div>

<div class="pros">
<p>Defining a parameter as reference avoids ugly code like

<p> Remember that most of the time input

<div class="pros">
<p>Often you have a function that uses default values, but
occasionally you want to override the defaults. Default

distinction between 'required' and 'optional'
arguments.</p>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<p>Function pointers are confusing in the presence of
default arguments, since the function signature often

argument to an existing function changes its type, which
can cause problems with code taking its address. Adding
function overloads avoids these problems. In addition,
default parameters may result in bulkier code since they
are replicated at every call-site -- as opposed to
overloaded functions, where "the default" appears only in

<h3 id="Exceptions">Exceptions</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>We do not use C++ exceptions.</p>

<div class="stylebody">

<div class="pros">
<ul>
  <li>Exceptions allow higher levels of an application to
  decide how to handle "can't happen" failures in deeply
  nested functions, without the obscuring and error-prone
  bookkeeping of error codes.</li>

  

  <li>Exceptions are used by most other
  modern languages. Using them in C++ would make it more
  consistent with Python, Java, and the C++ that others
  are familiar with.</li>

  <li>Some third-party C++ libraries use exceptions, and
  turning them off internally makes it harder to
  integrate with those libraries.</li>

  <li>Exceptions are the only way for a constructor to
  fail. We can simulate this with a factory function or
  an <code>Init()</code> method, but these require heap
  allocation or a new "invalid" state, respectively.</li>

  <li>Exceptions are really handy in testing
  frameworks.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<ul>
  <li>When you add a <code>throw</code> statement to an
  existing function, you must examine all of its
  transitive callers. Either they must make at least the
  basic exception safety guarantee, or they must never
  catch the exception and be happy with the program
  terminating as a result. For instance, if
  <code>f()</code> calls <code>g()</code> calls
  <code>h()</code>, and <code>h</code> throws an
  exception that <code>f</code> catches, <code>g</code>
  has to be careful or it may not clean up properly.</li>

  <li>More generally, exceptions make the control flow of
  programs difficult to evaluate by looking at code:
  functions may return in places you don't expect. This
  causes maintainability and debugging difficulties. You
  can minimize this cost via some rules on how and where
  exceptions can be used, but at the cost of more that a
  developer needs to know and understand.</li>

  <li>Exception safety requires both RAII and different
  coding practices. Lots of supporting machinery is
  needed to make writing correct exception-safe code
  easy. Further, to avoid requiring readers to understand
  the entire call graph, exception-safe code must isolate
  logic that writes to persistent state into a "commit"
  phase. This will have both benefits and costs (perhaps
  where you're forced to obfuscate code to isolate the
  commit). Allowing exceptions would force us to always
  pay those costs even when they're not worth it.</li>

  <li>Turning on exceptions adds data to each binary
  produced, increasing compile time (probably slightly)
  and possibly increasing address space pressure.
  </li>

  <li>The availability of exceptions may encourage
  developers to throw them when they are not appropriate
  or recover from them when it's not safe to do so. For
  example, invalid user input should not cause exceptions
  to be thrown. We would need to make the style guide
  even longer to document these restrictions!</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="decision">
<p>On their face, the benefits of using exceptions
outweigh the costs, especially in new projects. However,
for existing code, the introduction of exceptions has
implications on all dependent code. If exceptions can be
propagated beyond a new project, it also becomes
problematic to integrate the new project into existing
exception-free code. Because most existing C++ code at
Google is not prepared to deal with exceptions, it is
comparatively difficult to adopt new code that generates
exceptions.</p>

<p>Given that Google's existing code is not
exception-tolerant, the costs of using exceptions are
somewhat greater than the costs in a new project. The
conversion process would be slow and error-prone. We
don't believe that the available alternatives to
exceptions, such as error codes and assertions, introduce
a significant burden. </p>

<p>Our advice against using exceptions is not predicated
on philosophical or moral grounds, but practical ones.
 Because we'd like to use our open-source
projects at Google and it's difficult to do so if those
projects use exceptions, we need to advise against
exceptions in Google open-source projects as well.
Things would probably be different if we had to do it all
over again from scratch.</p>

<p>This prohibition also applies to the exception-related
features added in C++11, such as <code>noexcept</code>,

<p>Querying the type of an object at run-time frequently

<p>Undisciplined use of RTTI makes code hard to maintain.
It can lead to type-based decision trees or switch
statements scattered throughout the code, all of which
must be examined when making further changes.</p>
</div>

<div class="pros">
<p>The standard alternatives to RTTI (described below)
require modification or redesign of the class hierarchy
in question. Sometimes such modifications are infeasible
or undesirable, particularly in widely-used or mature
code.</p>

<p>RTTI can be useful in some unit tests. For example, it
is useful in tests of factory classes where the test has
to verify that a newly created object has the expected
dynamic type. It is also useful in managing the
relationship between objects and their mocks.</p>

<p>RTTI is useful when considering multiple abstract
objects. Consider</p>

<pre>bool Base::Equal(Base* other) = 0;
bool Derived::Equal(Base* other) {

<div class="decision">
<p>RTTI has legitimate uses but is prone to abuse, so you
must be careful when using it. You may use it freely in
unittests, but avoid it when possible in other code. In
particular, think twice before using RTTI in new code. If
you find yourself needing to write code that behaves
differently based on the class of an object, consider one
of the following alternatives to querying the type:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Virtual methods are the preferred way of executing
  different code paths depending on a specific subclass
  type. This puts the work within the object itself.</li>

  <li>If the work belongs outside the object and instead
  in some processing code, consider a double-dispatch
  solution, such as the Visitor design pattern. This
  allows a facility outside the object itself to
  determine the type of class using the built-in type
  system.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the logic of a program guarantees that a given
instance of a base class is in fact an instance of a
particular derived class, then a
<code>dynamic_cast</code> may be used freely on the
object.  Usually one
can use a <code>static_cast</code> as an alternative in
such situations.</p>

<p>Decision trees based on type are a strong indication
that your code is on the wrong track.</p>

<pre class="badcode">if (typeid(*data) == typeid(D1)) {

<p>Code such as this usually breaks when additional
subclasses are added to the class hierarchy. Moreover,
when properties of a subclass change, it is difficult to
find and modify all the affected code segments.</p>

</div>

<div class="stylepoint_subsection">
<h4>Extended Discussion</h4>

<p>There has been debate on this issue, so this explains
the reasoning in greater depth. Recall the Only One Way
guiding principle: we want to make sure that whenever we
do a certain type of I/O, the code looks the same in all
those places. Because of this, we do not want to allow
users to decide between using streams or using
<code>printf</code> plus Read/Write/etc. Instead, we
should settle on one or the other. We made an exception
for logging because it is a pretty specialized
application, and for historical reasons.</p>

<p>Proponents of streams have argued that streams are the
obvious choice of the two, but the issue is not actually
so clear. For every advantage of streams they point out,
there is an equivalent disadvantage. The biggest
advantage is that you do not need to know the type of the
object to be printing. This is a fair point. But, there
is a downside: you can easily use the wrong type, and the
compiler will not warn you. It is easy to make this kind
of mistake without knowing when using streams.</p>

<pre>cout &lt;&lt; this;  // Prints the address
cout &lt;&lt; *this;  // Prints the contents
</pre>

<p>The compiler does not generate an error because
<code>&lt;&lt;</code> has been overloaded. We discourage
overloading for just this reason.</p>

<p>Some say <code>printf</code> formatting is ugly and
hard to read, but streams are often no better. Consider
the following two fragments, both with the same typo.
Which is easier to discover?</p>


<pre>cerr &lt;&lt; "Error connecting to '" &lt;&lt; foo-&gt;bar()-&gt;hostname.first
     &lt;&lt; ":" &lt;&lt; foo-&gt;bar()-&gt;hostname.second &lt;&lt; ": " &lt;&lt; strerror(errno);

fprintf(stderr, "Error connecting to '%s:%u: %s",
        foo-&gt;bar()-&gt;hostname.first, foo-&gt;bar()-&gt;hostname.second,
        strerror(errno));
</pre>

<p>And so on and so forth for any issue you might bring
up. (You could argue, "Things would be better with the
right wrappers," but if it is true for one scheme, is it
not also true for the other? Also, remember the goal is

<div class="definition">
<p> When a variable
is incremented (<code>++i</code> or <code>i++</code>) or
decremented (<code>--i</code> or <code>i--</code>) and
the value of the expression is not used, one must decide
whether to preincrement (decrement) or postincrement
(decrement).</p>
</div>

<div class="pros">
<p>When the return value is ignored, the "pre" form
(<code>++i</code>) is never less efficient than the
"post" form (<code>i++</code>), and is often more
efficient. This is because post-increment (or decrement)
requires a copy of <code>i</code> to be made, which is
the value of the expression. If <code>i</code> is an
iterator or other non-scalar type, copying <code>i</code>
could be expensive. Since the two types of increment
behave the same when the value is ignored, why not just
always pre-increment?</p>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<p>The tradition developed, in C, of using post-increment
when the expression value is not used, especially in

<h4>Where to put the const</h4>

<p>Some people favor the form <code>int const *foo</code>

more readable because it's more consistent: it keeps the
rule that <code>const</code> always follows the object
it's describing. However, this consistency argument
doesn't apply in codebases with few deeply-nested pointer
expressions since most <code>const</code> expressions
have only one <code>const</code>, and it applies to the
underlying value. In such cases, there's no consistency
to maintain. Putting the <code>const</code> first is
arguably more readable, since it follows English in
putting the "adjective" (<code>const</code>) before the
"noun" (<code>int</code>).</p>

<p>
<code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code> defines types

those in preference to <code>short</code>, <code>unsigned

on the size of an integer. Of the C integer types, only

<p>We use <code>int</code> very often, for integers we

Use plain old <code>int</code> for such things. You

<p>You should not use the unsigned integer types such as

assertions for this.</p>



<p>If your code is a container that returns a size, be

introduce. Consider:</p>

<p>This code will never terminate! Sometimes gcc will
notice this bug and warn you, but often it will not.
Equally bad bugs can occur when comparing signed and

  <p>Note that the <code>PRI*</code> macros expand to
  independent strings which are concatenated by the

  format string, you need to insert the value of the
  macro into the format, rather than the name. It is
  still possible, as usual, to include length
  specifiers, etc., after the <code>%</code> when using
  the <code>PRI*</code> macros. So, e.g.
  <code>printf("x = %30"PRIuS"\n", x)</code> would
  expand on 32-bit Linux to <code>printf("x = %30" "u"
  "\n", x)</code>, which the compiler will treat as

  <li>You may need to be careful with structure
  alignments, particularly for structures being stored on
  disk. Any class/structure with a 
  <code>int64_t</code>/<code>uint64_t</code>
  member will by default end up being 8-byte aligned on a
  64-bit system. If you have such structures being shared
  on disk between 32-bit and 64-bit code, you will need
  to ensure that they are packed the same on both
  architectures. 
  Most compilers offer a way to
  alter structure alignment. For gcc, you can use
  <code>__attribute__((packed))</code>. MSVC offers
  <code>#pragma pack()</code> and
  <code>__declspec(align())</code>.</li>

  <li>
  <p>Use the <code>LL</code> or <code>ULL</code>

uint64_t my_mask = 3ULL &lt;&lt; 48;

<p>Luckily, macros are not nearly as necessary in C++ as
they are in C. Instead of using a macro to inline
performance-critical code, use an inline function.
Instead of using a macro to store a constant, use a
<code>const</code> variable. Instead of using a macro to
"abbreviate" a long variable name, use a reference.
Instead of using a macro to conditionally compile code
... well, don't do that at all (except, of course, for
the <code>#define</code> guards to prevent double
inclusion of header files). It makes testing much more
difficult.</p>

<p>Macros can do things these other techniques cannot,
and you do see them in the codebase, especially in the
lower-level libraries. And some of their special features
(like stringifying, concatenation, and so forth) are not
available through the language proper. But before using a
macro, consider carefully whether there's a non-macro way

  <li>Do not just <code>#undef</code> an existing macro

  that's likely to be unique.</li>

  <li>Try not to use macros that expand to unbalanced C++

<p>In C++11, this syntax was generalized, and any object type can now
be created with a braced initializer list, known as a
<i>braced-init-list</i> in the C++ grammar. Here are a few examples
of its use.</p>

<pre>// Vector takes a braced-init-list of elements.

// A map can take a list of pairs. Nested braced-init-lists work.
map&lt;int, string&gt; m = {{1, "one"}, {2, "2"}};

// A braced-init-list can be implicitly converted to a return type.
vector&lt;int&gt; test_function() { return {1, 2, 3}; }

// Iterate over a braced-init-list.

// Call a function using a braced-init-list.
void TestFunction2(vector&lt;int&gt; v) {}
TestFunction2({1, 2, 3});
</pre>

<p>A user-defined type can also define a constructor and/or assignment operator
that take <code>std::initializer_list&lt;T&gt;</code>, which is automatically
created from <i>braced-init-list</i>:</p>

<pre>class MyType {
 public:
  // std::initializer_list references the underlying init list.
  // It should be passed by value.
  MyType(std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt; init_list) {
    for (int i : init_list) append(i);
  }
  MyType&amp; operator=(std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt; init_list) {
    clear();
    for (int i : init_list) append(i);
  }
};
MyType m{2, 3, 5, 7};
</pre>

<p>Finally, brace initialization can also call ordinary
constructors of data types, even if they do not have
<code>std::initializer_list&lt;T&gt;</code> constructors.</p>

<pre>double d{1.23};
// Calls ordinary constructor as long as MyOtherType has no
// std::initializer_list constructor.
class MyOtherType {
 public:

  MyOtherType(int, string);
};
MyOtherType m = {1, "b"};
// If the constructor is explicit, you can't use the "= {}" form.
MyOtherType m{"b"};
</pre>

<p>Never assign a <i>braced-init-list</i> to an auto

means can be confusing.</p>

<li>Use lambda expressions where appropriate, with formatting as
described <a href="#Formatting_Lambda_Expressions">below</a>.</li>
<li>Do not use default captures; write all lambda captures explicitly.
For example, instead of <code>[=](int x) { return x + n; }</code>
you should write <code>[n](int x) { return x + n; }</code> so that
readers can see immediately that <code>n</code> is being captured
(by value).</li>
<li>Keep unnamed lambdas short.  If a lambda body is more than
maybe five lines long, prefer to give the lambda a name, or to
use a named function instead of a lambda.</li>

<h3 id="Template_metaprogramming">Template metaprogramming</h3>
<div class="summary">
<p>Avoid complicated template programming.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<div class="definition">
<p>Template metaprogramming refers to a family of techniques that
exploit the fact that the C++ template instantiation mechanism is
Turing complete and can be used to perform arbitrary compile-time
computation in the type domain.</p>
</div>

<div class="pros">
<p>Template metaprogramming allows extremely flexible interfaces that
are type safe and high performance. Facilities like

<a href="https://code.google.com/p/googletest/">Google Test</a>,
<code>std::tuple</code>, <code>std::function</code>, and
Boost.Spirit would be impossible without it.</p>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<p>The techniques used in template metaprogramming are often obscure
to anyone but language experts. Code that uses templates in
complicated ways is often unreadable, and is hard to debug or
maintain.</p>

<p>Template metaprogramming often leads to extremely poor compiler
time error messages: even if an interface is simple, the complicated
implementation details become visible when the user does something
wrong.</p>

<p>Template metaprogramming interferes with large scale refactoring by
making the job of refactoring tools harder. First, the template code
is expanded in multiple contexts, and it's hard to verify that the
transformation makes sense in all of them. Second, some refactoring
tools work with an AST that only represents the structure of the code
after template expansion. It can be difficult to automatically work
back to the original source construct that needs to be
rewritten.</p>
</div>

<div class="decision">
<p>Template metaprogramming sometimes allows cleaner and easier-to-use
interfaces than would be possible without it, but it's also often a
temptation to be overly clever. It's best used in a small number of
low level components where the extra maintenance burden is spread out
over a large number of uses.</p>

<p>Think twice before using template metaprogramming or other
complicated template techniques; think about whether the average
member of your team will be able to understand your code well enough
to maintain it after you switch to another project, or whether a
non-C++ programmer or someone casually browsing the code base will be
able to understand the error messages or trace the flow of a function
they want to call.  If you're using recursive template instantiations
or type lists or metafunctions or expression templates, or relying on
SFINAE or on the <code>sizeof</code> trick for detecting function
overload resolution, then there's a good chance you've gone too
far.</p>

<p>If you use template metaprogramming, you should expect to put
considerable effort into minimizing and isolating the complexity. You
should hide metaprogramming as an implementation detail whenever
possible, so that user-facing headers are readable, and you should
make sure that tricky code is especially well commented. You should
carefully document how the code is used, and you should say something
about what the "generated" code looks like. Pay extra attention to the
error messages that the compiler emits when users make mistakes.  The
error messages are part of your user interface, and your code should
be tweaked as necessary so that the error messages are understandable
and actionable from a user point of view.</p>

<h3 id="C++11">C++11</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Use libraries and language extensions from C++11 (formerly
known as C++0x) when appropriate. 
Consider portability to other environments
before using C++11 features in your
project. </p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<div class="definition">
<p> C++11 contains <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11">
significant changes</a> both to the language and
libraries. </p>
</div>

<div class="pros">
<p>C++11 was the official standard until august 2014, and
is supported by most C++ compilers. It standardizes
some common C++ extensions that we use already, allows
shorthands for some operations, and has some performance
and safety improvements.</p>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<p>The C++11 standard is substantially more complex than
its predecessor (1,300 pages versus 800 pages), and is
unfamiliar to many developers. The long-term effects of
some features on code readability and maintenance are
unknown. We cannot predict when its various features will
be implemented uniformly by tools that may be of
interest, particularly in the case of projects that are
forced to use older versions of tools.</p>

<p>As with <a href="#Boost">Boost</a>, some C++11
extensions encourage coding practices that hamper
readability&#8212;for example by removing
checked redundancy (such as type names) that may be
helpful to readers, or by encouraging template
metaprogramming. Other extensions duplicate functionality
available through existing mechanisms, which may lead to confusion
and conversion costs.</p>


</div>

<div class="decision">

<p>C++11 features may be used unless specified otherwise.
In addition to what's described in the rest of the style
guide, the following C++11 features may not be used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Functions (other than lambda functions)
  with trailing return types, e.g. writing
  <code>auto foo() -&gt; int;</code> instead of <code>int
  foo();</code>, because of a desire to preserve
  stylistic consistency with the many existing function
  declarations.</li>

  

  

  

  

  

  <li>Compile-time rational numbers
  (<code>&lt;ratio&gt;</code>), because of concerns that
  it's tied to a more template-heavy interface
  style.</li>

  <li>The <code>&lt;cfenv&gt;</code> and
  <code>&lt;fenv.h&gt;</code> headers, because many
  compilers do not support those features reliably.</li>

  

  <li>Default lambda captures.</li>
</ul>
</div>

</div> 

<h2 id="Naming">Naming</h2>

<p>The most important consistency rules are those that govern
naming. The style of a name immediately informs us what sort of
thing the named entity is: a type, a variable, a function, a
constant, a macro, etc., without requiring us to search for the
declaration of that entity. The pattern-matching engine in our
brains relies a great deal on these naming rules.
</p>

<p>Naming rules are pretty arbitrary, but
 we feel that
consistency is more important than individual preferences in this
area, so regardless of whether you find them sensible or not,
the rules are the rules.</p>

<h3 id="General_Naming_Rules">General Naming Rules</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Function names, variable names, and filenames should be
descriptive; eschew abbreviation.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">
<p>Give as descriptive a name as possible, within reason.
Do not worry about saving horizontal space as it is far
more important to make your code immediately
understandable by a new reader. Do not use abbreviations
that are ambiguous or unfamiliar to readers outside your
project, and do not abbreviate by deleting letters within
a word.</p>

<pre>int price_count_reader;    // No abbreviation.
int num_errors;            // "num" is a widespread convention.
int num_dns_connections;   // Most people know what "DNS" stands for.
</pre>

<pre class="badcode">int n;                     // Meaningless.
int nerr;                  // Ambiguous abbreviation.
int n_comp_conns;          // Ambiguous abbreviation.
int wgc_connections;       // Only your group knows what this stands for.
int pc_reader;             // Lots of things can be abbreviated "pc".
int cstmr_id;              // Deletes internal letters.
</pre>

<h3 id="File_Names">File Names</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Filenames should be all lowercase and can include
underscores (<code>_</code>) or dashes (<code>-</code>).
Follow the convention that your
 
project uses. If there is no consistent
local pattern to follow, prefer "_".</p>

<div class="stylebody">

<p>Examples of acceptable file names:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>my_useful_class.cc</code></li>
  <li><code>my-useful-class.cc</code></li>
  <li><code>myusefulclass.cc</code></li>
  <li><code>myusefulclass_test.cc // _unittest and _regtest are deprecated.</code></li>
</ul>

<p>C++ files should end in <code>.cc</code> and header files should end in
<code>.h</code>. Files that rely on being textually included at specific points
should end in <code>.inc</code> (see also the section on
<a href="#Self_contained_Headers">self-contained headers</a>).</p>

<p>Do not use filenames that already exist in
<code>/usr/include</code>, such as <code>db.h</code>.</p>

<p>In general, make your filenames very specific. For
example, use <code>http_server_logs.h</code> rather than
<code>logs.h</code>. A very common case is to have a pair
of files called, e.g., <code>foo_bar.h</code> and
<code>foo_bar.cc</code>, defining a class called
<code>FooBar</code>.</p>

<p>Inline functions must be in a <code>.h</code> file. If
your inline functions are very short, they should go
directly into your <code>.h</code> file. </p>

<h3 id="Type_Names">Type Names</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Type names start with a capital letter and have a capital
letter for each new word, with no underscores:

<div class="stylebody">

<p>The names of all types &#8212; classes, structs, typedefs,

<pre>// classes and structs
class UrlTable { ...

<div class="stylebody">

<h4 class="stylepoint_subsection">Common Variable names</h4>

</pre>

<h4 class="stylepoint_subsection">Class Data Members</h4>

<p>Data members of classes, both static and non-static, are

  string tablename_;   // OK.
  static Pool&lt;TableInfo&gt;* pool_;  // OK.

<h4 class="stylepoint_subsection">Struct Data Members</h4>

<p>Data members of structs, both static and non-static,

the trailing underscores that data members in classes have.</p>

<pre>struct UrlTableProperties {
  string name;
  int num_entries;
  static Pool&lt;UrlTableProperties&gt;* pool;
};
</pre>

versus a class.</p>

<h4 class="stylepoint_subsection">Global Variables</h4>

<p>There are no special requirements for global
variables, which should be rare in any case, but if you
use one, consider prefixing it with <code>g_</code> or
some other marker to easily distinguish it from local
variables.</p>

</div> 

<h3 id="Constant_Names">Constant Names</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Use a <code>k</code> followed by mixed case, e.g.,
<code>kDaysInAWeek</code>, for constants defined globally or within a class.</p>

<div class="stylebody">

<p>As a convenience to the reader, compile-time constants of global or class scope
follow a different naming convention from other variables.
Use a <code>k</code> followed by words with uppercase first letters:</p>

<pre>const int kDaysInAWeek = 7;
</pre>

<p>This convention may optionally be used for compile-time constants of local scope;
otherwise the usual variable naming rules apply.

<h3 id="Function_Names">Function Names</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Regular functions have mixed case; accessors and mutators

</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<h4 class="stylepoint_subsection">Regular Functions</h4>

<p>Functions should start with a capital letter and have
a capital letter for each new word. No underscores.</p>

<p>If your function crashes upon an error, you should
append OrDie to the function name. This only applies to
functions which could be used by production code and to
errors that are reasonably likely to occur during normal
operation.</p>

            <pre>AddTableEntry()
DeleteUrl()
OpenFileOrDie()
</pre>

<h4 class="stylepoint_subsection">Accessors and Mutators</h4>

<p>Accessors and mutators (get and set functions) should
match the name of the variable they are getting and
setting. This shows an excerpt of a class whose instance
variable is <code>num_entries_</code>.</p>

<pre>class MyClass {
 public:
  ...
  int num_entries() const { return num_entries_; }
  void set_num_entries(int num_entries) { num_entries_ = num_entries; }

 private:
  int num_entries_;
};
</pre>

<p>You may also use lowercase letters for other very
short inlined functions. For example if a function were
so cheap you would not cache the value if you were
calling it in a loop, then lowercase naming would be
acceptable.</p>

</div> 

<h3 id="Namespace_Names">Namespace Names</h3>

<div class="summary">


<p>Namespace names are all lower-case,

</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<p>Preferably, the individual enumerators should be named
like <a href="#Constant_Names">constants</a>. However, it
is also acceptable to name them like
<a href="Macro_Names">macros</a>.  The enumeration name,
<code>UrlTableErrors</code> (and
<code>AlternateUrlTableErrors</code>), is a type, and
therefore mixed case.</p>

<pre>enum UrlTableErrors {

  kErrorOutOfMemory,
  kErrorMalformedInput,

enum AlternateUrlTableErrors {
  OK = 0,
  OUT_OF_MEMORY = 1,
  MALFORMED_INPUT = 2,
};
</pre>

<p>Until January 2009, the style was to name enum values
like <a href="#Macro_Names">macros</a>. This caused
problems with name collisions between enum values and
macros. Hence, the change to prefer constant-style naming
was put in place. New code should prefer constant-style
naming if possible. However, there is no reason to change
old code to use constant-style names, unless the old
names are actually causing a compile-time problem.</p>

<p>Every function declaration should have comments

  must free.</li>

  <li>Whether any of the arguments can be a null

<pre>// Returns an iterator for this table.  It is the client's
// responsibility to delete the iterator when it is done with it,
// and it must not use the iterator once the GargantuanTable object
// on which the iterator was created has been deleted.
//
// The iterator is initially positioned at the beginning of the table.
//
// This method is equivalent to:
//    Iterator* iter = table-&gt;NewIterator();
//    iter-&gt;Seek("");
//    return iter;
// If you are going to immediately seek to another place in the
// returned iterator, it will be faster to use NewIterator()
// and avoid the extra seek.
Iterator* GetIterator() const;
</pre>

<p>However, do not be unnecessarily verbose or state the
completely obvious. Notice below that it is not necessary
 to say "returns false otherwise" because this is
implied.</p>

<pre>// Returns true if the table cannot hold any more entries.
bool IsTableFull();
</pre>

<p>When commenting constructors and destructors, remember
that the person reading your code knows what constructors
and destructors are for, so comments that just say
something like "destroys this object" are not useful.
Document what constructors do with their arguments (for
example, if they take ownership of pointers), and what
cleanup the destructor does. If this is trivial, just
skip the comment. It is quite common for destructors not
to have a header comment.</p>

<h4 class="stylepoint_subsection">Function Definitions</h4>

<p>If there is anything tricky about how a function does
its job, the function definition should have an
explanatory comment. For example, in the definition
comment you might describe any coding tricks you use,
give an overview of the steps you go through, or explain
why you chose to implement the function in the way you
did rather than using a viable alternative. For instance,
you might mention why it must acquire a lock for the
first half of the function but why it is not needed for
the second half.</p>

<p>Note you should <em>not</em> just repeat the comments
given with the function declaration, in the
<code>.h</code> file or wherever. It's okay to
recapitulate briefly what the function does, but the
focus of the comments should be on how it does it.</p>

</div> 

<h3 id="Variable_Comments">Variable Comments</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>In general the actual name of the variable should be
descriptive enough to give a good idea of what the variable
is used for. In certain cases, more comments are required.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<h4 class="stylepoint_subsection">Class Data Members</h4>

<p>Each class data member (also called an instance
variable or member variable) should have a comment
describing what it is used for. If the variable can take
sentinel values with special meanings, such as a null
pointer or -1, document this. For example:</p>


<pre>private:
 // Keeps track of the total number of entries in the table.
 // Used to ensure we do not go over the limit. -1 means
 // that we don't yet know how many entries the table has.
 int num_total_entries_;
</pre>

<h4 class="stylepoint_subsection">Global Variables</h4>

<p>As with data members, all global variables should have
a comment describing what they are and what they are used
for. For example:</p>

<pre>// The total number of tests cases that we run through in this regression test.
const int kNumTestCases = 6;
</pre>

</div> 

<h3 id="Implementation_Comments">Implementation Comments</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>In your implementation you should have comments in tricky,
non-obvious, interesting, or important parts of your code.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<h4 class="stylepoint_subsection">Explanatory Comments</h4>

<p>Tricky or complicated code blocks should have comments
before them. Example:</p>

<pre>// Divide result by two, taking into account that x
// contains the carry from the add.
for (int i = 0; i &lt; result-&gt;size(); i++) {
  x = (x &lt;&lt; 8) + (*result)[i];
  (*result)[i] = x &gt;&gt; 1;
  x &amp;= 1;
}
</pre>

<h4 class="stylepoint_subsection">Line Comments</h4>

<p>Also, lines that are non-obvious should get a comment
at the end of the line. These end-of-line comments should
be separated from the code by 2 spaces. Example:</p>

<pre>// If we have enough memory, mmap the data portion too.
mmap_budget = max&lt;int64&gt;(0, mmap_budget - index_-&gt;length());
if (mmap_budget &gt;= data_size_ &amp;&amp; !MmapData(mmap_chunk_bytes, mlock))
  return;  // Error already logged.
</pre>

<p>Note that there are both comments that describe what
the code is doing, and comments that mention that an
error has already been logged when the function
returns.</p>

<p>If you have several comments on subsequent lines, it
can often be more readable to line them up:</p>

<pre>DoSomething();                  // Comment here so the comments line up.
DoSomethingElseThatIsLonger();  // Two spaces between the code and the comment.
{ // One space before comment when opening a new scope is allowed,
  // thus the comment lines up with the following comments and code.
  DoSomethingElse();  // Two spaces before line comments normally.
}
vector&lt;string&gt; list{// Comments in braced lists describe the next element ..
                    "First item",
                    // .. and should be aligned appropriately.
                    "Second item"};
DoSomething(); /* For trailing block comments, one space is fine. */
</pre>

<h4 class="stylepoint_subsection">nullptr/NULL, true/false, 1, 2, 3...</h4>

<p>When you pass in a null pointer, boolean, or literal
integer values to functions, you should consider adding a
comment about what they are, or make your code
self-documenting by using constants. For example,
compare:</p>

<pre class="badcode">bool success = CalculateSomething(interesting_value,
                                  10,
                                  false,
                                  NULL);  // What are these arguments??
</pre>

<p>versus:</p>

<pre>bool success = CalculateSomething(interesting_value,
                                  10,     // Default base value.
                                  false,  // Not the first time we're calling this.
                                  NULL);  // No callback.
</pre>

<p>Or alternatively, constants or self-describing variables:</p>

<pre>const int kDefaultBaseValue = 10;
const bool kFirstTimeCalling = false;
Callback *null_callback = NULL;
bool success = CalculateSomething(interesting_value,
                                  kDefaultBaseValue,
                                  kFirstTimeCalling,
                                  null_callback);
</pre>

<h4 class="stylepoint_subsection">Don'ts</h4>

<p>Note that you should <em>never</em> describe the code
itself. Assume that the person reading the code knows C++
better than you do, even though he or she does not know
what you are trying to do:</p>

<pre class="badcode">// Now go through the b array and make sure that if i occurs,
// the next element is i+1.
...        // Geez.  What a useless comment.
</pre>

</div> 

<h3 id="Punctuation,_Spelling_and_Grammar">Punctuation, Spelling and Grammar</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Pay attention to punctuation, spelling, and grammar; it is
easier to read well-written comments than badly written

</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<p>Comments should be as readable as narrative text, with
proper capitalization and punctuation. In many cases,
complete sentences are more readable than sentence
fragments. Shorter comments, such as comments at the end
of a line of code, can sometimes be less formal, but you
should be consistent with your style.</p>

<p>Although it can be frustrating to have a code reviewer
point out that you are using a comma when you should be
using a semicolon, it is very important that source code
maintain a high level of clarity and readability. Proper
punctuation, spelling, and grammar help with that
goal.</p>

<p><code>TODO</code>s should include the string

main purpose is to have a consistent <code>TODO</code> that
can be searched to find out how to get more details upon
request. A <code>TODO</code> is not a commitment that the
person referenced will fix the problem. Thus when you create
a <code>TODO</code>, it is almost always your

<h3 id="Deprecation_Comments">Deprecation Comments</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Mark deprecated interface points with <code>DEPRECATED</code>
comments.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<p>You can mark an interface as deprecated by writing a
comment containing the word <code>DEPRECATED</code> in
all caps. The comment goes either before the declaration
of the interface or on the same line as the

<p>After the word
<code>DEPRECATED</code>, write your name, e-mail address,
or other identifier in parentheses.</p>

<p>A deprecation comment must include simple, clear
directions for people to fix their callsites. In C++, you
can implement a deprecated function as an inline function
that calls the new interface point.</p>

<p>Marking an interface point <code>DEPRECATED</code>
will not magically cause any callsites to change. If you
want people to actually stop using the deprecated
facility, you will have to fix the callsites yourself or
recruit a crew to help you.</p>

<p>New code should not contain calls to deprecated
interface points. Use the new interface point instead. If
you cannot understand the directions, find the person who
created the deprecation and ask them for help using the
new interface point.</p>

<h2 id="Formatting">Formatting</h2>

<p>Coding style and formatting are pretty arbitrary, but a

project is much easier to follow
if everyone uses the same style. Individuals may not agree with every
aspect of the formatting rules, and some of the rules may take
some getting used to, but it is important that all

project contributors follow the
style rules so that 
they can all read and understand
everyone's code easily.</p>

<h3 id="Line_Length">Line Length</h3>

<p>Each line of text in your code should be at most 80
characters long.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">



 <p>We recognize that this rule is
controversial, but so much existing code already adheres
to it, and we feel that consistency is important.</p>

<div class="pros">
<p>Those who favor  this rule
argue that it is rude to force them to resize
their windows and there is no need for anything longer.
Some folks are used to having several code windows
side-by-side, and thus don't have room to widen their
windows in any case. People set up their work environment
assuming a particular maximum window width, and 80
columns has been the traditional standard. Why change
it?</p>
</div>

<div class="cons">
<p>Proponents of change argue that a wider line can make

<h3 id="Non-ASCII_Characters">Non-ASCII Characters</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Non-ASCII characters should be rare, and must use UTF-8
formatting.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<p>You shouldn't hard-code user-facing text in source,
even English, so use of non-ASCII characters should be
rare. However, in certain cases it is appropriate to
include such words in your code. For example, if your
code parses data files from foreign sources, it may be
appropriate to hard-code the non-ASCII string(s) used in
those data files as delimiters. More commonly, unittest
code (which does not  need to be localized) might
contain non-ASCII strings. In such cases, you should use
UTF-8, since that is  an encoding
understood by most tools able to handle more than just
ASCII.</p>

<p>Hex encoding is also OK, and encouraged where it
enhances readability &#8212; for example,
<code>"\xEF\xBB\xBF"</code>, or, even more simply,
<code>u8"\uFEFF"</code>, is the Unicode zero-width
no-break space character, which would be invisible if
included in the source as straight UTF-8.</p>

<p>Use the <code>u8</code> prefix
to guarantee that a string literal containing
<code>\uXXXX</code> escape sequences is encoded as UTF-8.
Do not use it for strings containing non-ASCII characters
encoded as UTF-8, because that will produce incorrect
output if the compiler does not interpret the source file
as UTF-8. </p>

<p>You shouldn't use the C++11 <code>char16_t</code> and
<code>char32_t</code> character types, since they're for
non-UTF-8 text. For similar reasons you also shouldn't
use <code>wchar_t</code> (unless you're writing code that
interacts with the Windows API, which uses

  <li>The close curly brace is either on the last line by

  <li>There should be a space between the close

on each line where appropriate.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<p>Function calls have the following format:</p>

<p>Put multiple arguments on a single line to reduce the
number of lines necessary for calling a function unless
there is a specific readability problem. Some find that
formatting with strictly one argument on each line is
more readable and simplifies editing of the arguments.
However, we prioritize for the reader over the ease of
editing arguments, and most readability problems are
better addressed with the following techniques.</p>

<p>If having multiple arguments in a single line decreases
readability due to the complexity or confusing nature of the
expressions that make up some arguments, try creating
variables that capture those arguments in a descriptive name:</p>
<pre>int my_heuristic = scores[x] * y + bases[x];
bool retval = DoSomething(my_heuristic, x, y, z);
</pre>

<p>Or put the confusing argument on its own line with
an explanatory comment:</p>
<pre>bool retval = DoSomething(scores[x] * y + bases[x],  // Score heuristic.
                          x, y, z);
</pre>

<p>If there is still a case where one argument is
significantly more readable on its own line, then put it on
its own line. The decision should be specific to the argument
which is made more readable rather than a general policy.</p>

<p>Sometimes arguments form a structure that is important
for readability. In those cases, feel free to format the
arguments according to that structure:</p>
<pre>// Transform the widget by a 3x3 matrix.
my_widget.Transform(x1, x2, x3,

<p>The most common form is without spaces. Either is
fine, but <em>be consistent</em>. If you are modifying a

<p>Be careful when using a braced initialization list <code>{...}</code>

A nonempty <i>braced-init-list</i> prefers the

non-<code>std::initializer_list</code> constructor, use parentheses
instead of braces.</p>

<p>Adding trailing whitespace can cause extra work for

<h3 id="Vertical_Whitespace">Vertical Whitespace</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p>Minimize use of vertical whitespace.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">

<p>This is more a principle than a rule: don't use blank
lines when you don't have to. In particular, don't put
more than one or two blank lines between functions,
resist starting functions with a blank line, don't end
functions with a blank line, and be discriminating with
your use of blank lines inside functions.</p>

<p>The basic principle is: The more code that fits on one
screen, the easier it is to follow and understand the
control flow of the program. Of course, readability can
suffer from code being too dense as well as too spread
out, so use your judgement. But in general, minimize use
of vertical whitespace.</p>

<p>Some rules of thumb to help when blank lines may be
useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blank lines at the beginning or end of a function
  very rarely help readability.</li>

  <li>Blank lines inside a chain of if-else blocks may
  well help readability.</li>

<h3 id="Windows_Code">Windows Code</h3>

<div class="summary">
<p> Windows
programmers have developed their own set of coding
conventions, mainly derived from the conventions in Windows
headers and other Microsoft code. We want to make it easy
for anyone to understand your code, so we have a single set
of guidelines for everyone writing C++ on any platform.</p>
</div>

<div class="stylebody">
<p>It is worth reiterating a few of the guidelines that
you might forget if you are used to the prevalent Windows
style:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not use Hungarian notation (for example, naming
  an integer <code>iNum</code>). Use the Google naming
  conventions, including the <code>.cc</code> extension
  for source files.</li>

  <li>Windows defines many of its own synonyms for
  primitive types, such as <code>DWORD</code>,
  <code>HANDLE</code>, etc. It is perfectly acceptable,
  and encouraged, that you use these types when calling
  Windows API functions. Even so, keep as close as you
  can to the underlying C++ types. For example, use
  <code>const TCHAR *</code> instead of
  <code>LPCTSTR</code>.</li>

  <li>When compiling with Microsoft Visual C++, set the
  compiler to warning level 3 or higher, and treat all
  warnings as errors.</li>

  <li>Do not use <code>#pragma once</code>; instead use
  the standard Google include guards. The path in the
  include guards should be relative to the top of your
  project tree.</li>

  <li>In fact, do not use any nonstandard extensions,
  like <code>#pragma</code> and <code>__declspec</code>,
  unless you absolutely must. Using
  <code>__declspec(dllimport)</code> and
  <code>__declspec(dllexport)</code> is allowed; however,
  you must use them through macros such as
  <code>DLLIMPORT</code> and <code>DLLEXPORT</code>, so
  that someone can easily disable the extensions if they
  share the code.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, there are just a few rules that we
occasionally need to break on Windows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Normally we <a href="#Multiple_Inheritance">forbid
  the use of multiple implementation inheritance</a>;
  however, it is required when using COM and some ATL/WTL
  classes. You may use multiple implementation
  inheritance to implement COM or ATL/WTL classes and
  interfaces.</li>

  <li>Although you should not use exceptions in your own
  code, they are used extensively in the ATL and some
  STLs, including the one that comes with Visual C++.
  When using the ATL, you should define
  <code>_ATL_NO_EXCEPTIONS</code> to disable exceptions.
  You should investigate whether you can also disable
  exceptions in your STL, but if not, it is OK to turn on
  exceptions in the compiler. (Note that this is only to
  get the STL to compile. You should still not write
  exception handling code yourself.)</li>

  <li>The usual way of working with precompiled headers
  is to include a header file at the top of each source
  file, typically with a name like <code>StdAfx.h</code>
  or <code>precompile.h</code>. To make your code easier
  to share with other projects, avoid including this file
  explicitly (except in <code>precompile.cc</code>), and
  use the <code>/FI</code> compiler option to include the
  file automatically.</li>

  <li>Resource headers, which are usually named
  <code>resource.h</code> and contain only macros, do not
  need to conform to these style guidelines.</li>
</ul>

</div> 

 

<h2 class="ignoreLink">Parting Words</h2>

<p>Use common sense and <em>BE CONSISTENT</em>.</p>

<p>If you are editing code, take a few minutes to look at the
code around you and determine its style. If they use spaces
around their <code>if</code> clauses, you should, too. If their
comments have little boxes of stars around them, make your
comments have little boxes of stars around them too.</p>

<p>The point of having style guidelines is to have a common
vocabulary of coding so people can concentrate on what you are
saying, rather than on how you are saying it. We present global
style rules here so people know the vocabulary. But local style
is also important. If code you add to a file looks drastically
different from the existing code around it, the discontinuity
throws readers out of their rhythm when they go to read it. Try
to avoid this.</p>



<p>OK, enough writing about writing code; the code itself is much
more interesting. Have fun!</p>

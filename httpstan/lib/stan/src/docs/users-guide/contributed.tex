\chapter{Contributed Modules}

\noindent
Stan is an open-source project and welcomes user contributions.

In order to reduce maintenance on the main trunk of Stan development
and to allow developer-specified licenses, contributed Stan modules
are not distributed as part of Stan itself.

Each contributed module on \code{stan-dev}'s GitHub space comes with
its own documentation, indexed by the \code{README.md} file displayed
on GitHub.  Each contributed module has its own licensing the terms of
which are controlled by its developers.  The license for a contributed
package and its dependencies can be found in a top-level directory
\code{licenses/}.

\subsection{Emacs Stan Mode}

\noindent
Emacs Stan mode allows syntax highlighting and automatic indentation
of Stan models in the Emacs text editor.

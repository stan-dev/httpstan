This is the official reference manual for Stan's *programming
language* for coding probability models, *inference algorithms* for
fitting models and making predictions, and *posterior analysis* tools
for evaluating the results.  This manual applies to all Stan
inteferfaces.

There are two additional interface-neutral manuals, a *Functions
Reference* listing all the built-in functions and their signatures,
and a *User's Guide* providing examples and programming techniques.
There is also a separate installation and getting started guide for
each interface.

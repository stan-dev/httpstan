Contributing to httpstan
========================

Principles
----------

httpstan emerged out of a rewrite of an existing piece of software (PyStan)
which was very difficult to maintain. httpstan aims to be maintainable. Code
contributions should be readable and easy to understand.

How to Make a Code Contribution
-------------------------------

httpstan adopts virtually all the conventions and procedures discussed in Astropy's `How to make a
code contribution`_. Deviations, if any emerge, will be added to this section.

In general, contributions which follow the project's coding style, have tests, and solve a specific
problem will be merged. Here the project follows the spirit of the `Collective Code Construction
Contract (C4)`_.

Coding Style
------------

httpstan code is `PEP 8`_ compliant. The project uses the code formatter black_ with a maximum
line-length of 99 characters.

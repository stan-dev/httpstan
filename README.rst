HTTP interface to Stan, a package for Bayesian inference.

An HTTP 1.1 interface to the Stan_ C++ package, **httpstan** is a shim_ that
allows users to interact with the Stan C++ library using a `Web API`_. The
package is intended for use as a universal backend for frontends which know how
to make HTTP requests. The primary audience for this package is developers.

In addition to providing all the functionality of the command-line interface
to Stan (CmdStan_) over HTTP 1.1, **httpstan** provides:

* Automatic caching of compiled Stan Programs and samples from programs.
* Parallel sampling.

Important Disclaimer
====================
**httpstan** is experimental software. This software is not intended for general use.

httpstan currently requires Python 3.6 as it uses asynchronous generators (PEP525). Support for
Python 3.5 may emerge at some point. No older versions of Python will be supported.

Background
==========

**httpstan** is a shim_ allowing clients speaking HTTP to call functions in the
Stan C++ package's ``stan::services`` namespace. **httpstan** was originally
developed as a "backend" for a Python interface to Stan, PyStan_.

Install
=======

::

    python3 -m pip install httpstan

Usage
=====

After installing ``httpstan``, running the module will begin listening on
localhost, port 8080::

    python3 -m httpstan

In a different terminal, make a POST request to
``http://localhost:8080/v1/programs`` with a Stan Program to compile the
program::

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"program_code":"parameters {real y;} model {y ~ normal(0,1);}"}' \
        http://localhost:8080/v1/programs

This request will return a program id similar to the following::

    {"program": {"id": "8137474d19926b0aa8efd4f1d3944131d59269d97a7bd8dab8e79d667eb314df"}}

(The program ``id`` will be different on different platforms and with different versions of Stan.)

To draw samples from this model using default settings, we make the following request::

    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"type":"hmc_nuts_diag_e_adapt"}' \
        http://localhost:8080/v1/programs/8137474d19926b0aa8efd4f1d3944131d59269d97a7bd8dab8e79d667eb314df/actions

This request will return samples from the normal distribution. The output is
taken more or less directly from the output of the relevant function defined by
the Stan C++ package (in the ``stan::services`` namespace). Consult the Stan
C++ documentation for details.

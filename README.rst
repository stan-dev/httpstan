HTTP-based REST interface to Stan, a package for Bayesian inference.

An HTTP 1.1 interface to the Stan_ C++ package, **httpstan** is a shim_ that
allows users to interact with the Stan C++ library using a REST API. The
package is intended for use as a universal backend for frontends which know how
to make HTTP requests. The primary audience for this package is developers.

In addition to providing the essential functionality of the command-line interface
to Stan (CmdStan_) over HTTP, **httpstan** provides the following features:

* Automatic caching of compiled Stan models
* Automatic caching of samples from Stan models
* Parallel sampling

Documentation: `https://httpstan.readthedocs.org <https://httpstan.readthedocs.org>`_.

Requirements
============

- Python version 3.6 or higher.
- macOS or Linux.

Background
==========

**httpstan** is a shim_ allowing clients able to make HTTP-based requests to
call functions in the Stan C++ library's ``stan::services`` namespace.
**httpstan** was originally developed as a "backend" for a Stan interface
written in Python, PyStan_.

Stability and maintainability are two overriding goals of this software package.

Install
=======

.. These instructions appear in both README.rst and installation.rst

::

    $ python3 -m pip install httpstan


Usage
=====

After installing ``httpstan``, running the module will begin listening on
localhost, port 8080::

    python3 -m httpstan

In a different terminal, make a POST request to
``http://localhost:8080/v1/models`` with Stan program code to compile the
program::

    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --data '{"program_code":"parameters {real y;} model {y ~ normal(0,1);}"}' \
        http://localhost:8080/v1/models

This request will return a model name along with all the compiler output::

    {"name": "models/xc2pdjb4", "compiler_output": "In file included from â€¦"}

(The model ``name`` depends on the platform and the version of Stan.)

Drawing samples from this model using default settings requires two steps: (1)
launching the sampling operation and (2) retrieving the output of the operation
(once it has finished).

First we make a request to launch the sampling operation::

    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --data '{"function":"stan::services::sample::hmc_nuts_diag_e_adapt"}' \
        http://localhost:8080/v1/models/xc2pdjb4/fits

This request instructs ``httpstan`` to draw samples from the normal
distribution described in the model. The function name picks out a specific
function in the ``stan::services`` namespace found in the Stan C++ library (see
the Stan C++ documentation for details).  This request will return immediately
with a reference to a long-running fit operation::

    {"name": "operations/gkf54axb", "done": false, "metadata": {"fit": {"name": "models/xc2pdjb4/fits/gkf54axb"}}}

Once the operation is complete, the "fit" can be retrieved. The name of the fit,
``models/xc2pdjb4/fits/gkf54axb``, is included in the ``metadata`` field of the operation.
The fit is saved as sequence of Protocol Buffer messages. These messages are strung together
using `length-prefix encoding
<https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/08/02/length-prefix-framing-for-protocol-buffers>`_.  To
retrieve these messages, saving them locally in the file ``myfit.bin``, make the following request::

    curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models/xc2pdjb4/fits/gkf54axb > myfit.bin

To read the messages you will need a library for reading the encoding that
Protocol Buffer messages use.  In this example we will read the first message
in the stream using the Protocol Buffer compiler tool ``protoc``. (On
Debian-based Linux you can find this tool in the ``protobuf-compiler``
package.) The following command skips the message length (one byte)
and then decodes the message (which is 13 bytes in length)::

    dd bs=1 skip=1 if=myfit.bin 2>/dev/null | head -c 13 | \
      protoc --decode stan.WriterMessage protos/callbacks_writer.proto

.. To get the 13 bytes, use google.protobuf.internal.decoder._DecodeVarint32(fit_bytes, 0)

Running the command above decodes the first message in the stream. The
decoded message should resemble the following::

    topic: LOGGER
    feature {
      string_list {
        value: "info:"
      }
    }

This empty logger message is not particularly informative.
The next message is more interesting. It reads::

   topic: LOGGER
   feature {
     string_list {
       value: "info:Gradient evaluation took 4.7e-05 seconds"
     }
   }

The Stan "fit", saved in ``myfit.bin``, aggregates all messages. By reading
them one by one you can recover all messages sent by the Stan C++ library.

 Updating Stan Source
======================

*This document is intended for httpstan developers.*

Updating Stan source is a chore which must be done every time there is a new
release of the Stan source code. Update the Stan source by deleting all files
in ``httpstan/lib/stan`` and extracting the Stan release tarball to that
directory.
